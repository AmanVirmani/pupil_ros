# Pupil ROS
This ROS package maps user's gaze data from the [Pupil Labs eye tracker](https://pupil-labs.com/), onto a different video feed, using markers and feature matching.

## Requirements
1. Ubuntu 16.04

2. ROS Kinetic installation. Older versions may work but are not tested.

## Installation
1. **Install Pupil Capture** Download [here](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/)

2. **Install pip**

    >sudo apt-get install python-pip

    >sudo pip install --upgrade pip

3. **Install zmq**

    >sudo pip install pyzmq

4. **Install sox**

    >sudo apt-get install sox

5. **Place the folder pupil_ros to your catkin workspace, and build the ROS package.**

    >cd Path/To/catkin_ws

    >catkin_make

    >source devel/setup.bash

    This will build six custom ROS messages: pupil, pupil_positions, gaze, gaze_positions, surface_position, accu

6. **Print markers**

    Print the QR-code like trackers. They can be found inside the **markers/** folder

## Using the package

1. **Make pupil_zmq_ros_pub.py executable**

    cd to the installed pupil_ros package in your catkin workspace:

    >cd ~/catkin_ws/src/pupil_ros/scripts

    >chmod +x pupil_zmq_ros_pub.py main_run_v4.py audio_output.py start_pupil.py

2. **Launch ROS package:**

    >roslaunch pupil_ros pupil_ros.launch

    Pupil Capture will launch automatically.

3. **Set correct settings in Pupil Remote:**

* Load plugin **Pupil_Remote** and **Frame_Publisher**

* Set localhost to 50010

* Set Frame Publisher to bgr

4. **Calibrate Pupil Remote**

    Calibrate the eye tracker using a calibration method of your choice. 



## How to grab the accuracy data

1. Setup rosbag record 

    >rosbag record matcher/gaze_accu

2. Quit recording when ready

3. Make csv file with custom BAGFILE_NAME and LOGFILE_NAME (or logfile.txt)

    >rostopic echo -b BAGFILE_NAME.bag -p /matcher/gaze_accu > LOGFILE_NAME.csv
